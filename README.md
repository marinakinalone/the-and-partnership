## About this repository

To view the three banners 'in action' on a landing page, click on the deployment link or follow the instructions below (to display on a local machine).
To get a further look at the codebase for all three projects, go to the ```public/html``` folder where you will find three folders :
- Nordea Fleet
- Nordea Video
- Lexus Line
  
Each of the folders above works as a standalone, meaning that you can see the result one by one by opening the ```index.html``` file 

## Installation

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
